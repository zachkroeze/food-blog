Ingredients:
4 tbps olive oil
4 cups mixed mushrooms cut in large pieces
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp chopped thyme
1 tbsp chopped rosemary
salt and pepper
2 + 1/4 cups vegetable stock
1/2 cup polenta
5 oz grated parmesan
4 tbps butter
14g dried mushrooms
2 + 1/2 cups water
1 tbps flour


Bring the water to a boil in a sauce pot and add the dried mushrooms. The stock will take 20 min or so to get fully flavoured, in the meantime prepare the rest of your ingredients. Heat half the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium high heat. Cook the mushrooms in batched so that the mushrooms get drowned nicely and not steamed. Do not overcrowd the pan. Once all the mushrooms have been browned, add garlic, thyme and cook for 1-2 minutes until galric has softened. Sprinkle in the flour and cook for another 2 min. Add the mushroom stock and let simmer until desired thickness is reached. Add 2 tbps of butter. Turn heat off and keep warm.

Bring the vegetable stock to a boil in a saucepan. Slowly stir in the polenta, reduce to a minimum and cook stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Do not leave the pot, keep stirring vigilently. You are looking for the polenta to leave the side on the pan, but still be runny. The time for this will depend on the type of polenta, a rough estimate will be given on the back of your polenta package (5 min for instant, and 20-50 minutes for non-instant). If it seems dry, add small amounts of stock until desired consistency is reached.

When the polenta is ready, add the remaining butter, 3 oz of the parmesan, rosemary, salt and pepper. Pour the polenta into individual bowls, or a big serving dish. Push a little well into the polenta, and fill with the mushroom gravy. Top with remaining parmesan. Serve immediately.
